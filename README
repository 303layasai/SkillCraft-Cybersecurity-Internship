## üìÅ Projects

### Task 1: Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

**Overview:** A Python script that encrypts/decrypts text using the Caesar cipher with adjustable shift values, including file input/output.

**Features:**
- Encrypt and decrypt plain text using a shift key  
- Supports wrap-around at the end of the alphabet  
- Read from and write to files  

---

### Task 2: Pixel Image Encryption

**Overview:** Encrypt and decrypt image files via pixel-level manipulation and mathematical operations.

**Features:**
- Swap pixels using pseudo-random sequence  
- Modify pixel values using key based mathematical transforms  

---

### Task 3: Password Complexity Checker

**Overview:** A CLI tool to evaluate password strength based on several criteria.

**Features:**
- Checks **length**, **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **number**, **special character**  
- Classifies password strength: *Weak*, *Good*, *Strong*
