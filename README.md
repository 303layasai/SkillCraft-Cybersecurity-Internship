# About the Internship

.💼 Internship Domain: Cybersecurity

.🏢 Company: SkillCraft Technology

.📅 Duration: [sep:1 to oct:1]

.📌 Description: Hands-on tasks involving encryption, secure password handling, and basic ethical hacking using Python.

#Tech Stack:

.👨‍💻 Language: Python 3.x

.📦 Libraries Used:

                 .cryptography

                  .pynput

                  .PIL / OpenCV (if used for image encryption)

                   .os, sys, base64

.

# # 🔐 Task 1 – Encryption:

File: task1_encryption.py
